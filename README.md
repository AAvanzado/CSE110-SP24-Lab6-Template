### Q1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? 
_Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed_ 
<br>
This is because we would want every change made to the repository to be checked against the tests in order to ensure that no new errors have been introduced.

### Q2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
Yes; E2E testing checks if a some given functionality of the page is working correctly, which includes returning the correct output.
